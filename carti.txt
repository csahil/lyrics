No ventilation, hoes stimulating on this novacane I'm making
Still searching for the one
We in the Matrix
Words from the sea 
Never gave a fuck about the preacher
Muscle arms, muscle arms cooking up with baking soda
God never let my enemies get between insanity and Hova
Turning clouds into castles and pan slow cameras roll
These bitches listen to us like we got mind control
Overdose my high nigga, I'm flying
By the jets shout out the sky nigga, I'm dying
I take a pound and break it down into a baby bud
Roll up a spliff, then I light it up, now take a puff
It takes concentration when I'm blazing on this elevation
Now treat your hate with my herbal medication
Yeah nigga, true statement

You smoking reefers?
Yeah, of course we are, can't you smell it?
No, Sam, I can't
Come on, Dewey!
Join the party!
No, Dewey!
You don't want this
Get out of here!
You know what?
I don't want no hangover
I can't get no hangover
It doesn't give you a hangover
Well, I get addicted to it or something?
It's not habitforming
I don't wanna overdose on it
You can't OD on it
It's not gonna make me wanna have sex, is it?
It makes sex even better
Sounds kinda expensive
It's the cheapest drug there is

Have you heard what you prefer
Don't talk what you walk, nigga work
Sipping on light pink, I think much different
Make a grown man evolve to an infant
Guns involved, our coverage goes different
Your body get found, no revision
Don’t judge me off of what you see in the album
Right tight, see when I shower
On the herb, I'm an owl
Bitch, I'm a G, not a word with a vowel
Holy shit, Rollie my wrist
Holding her hand, she holding my dick
Giving me gas, still treat her like shit
Feed her the needle, bitch I'm a prick
Sitting back, holding my niggas on the fuck shit
Just smoking on that loud, that's very disruptive
In the clouds at every function
Gold on my ear, blowing down on an onion
Just me and my niggas, we team real
Middle finger how you feel
Just an insomniac
Get my name in cardiac

Chillin' with my TEC, bruh
My nigga on that lean (That’s right)
Theses hoes on these beans
And they all got that from me (Carti)
Yung Carti, I'm a G
Respected in the streets
Kilos from off the beach
Banana Boat, chillin' with the heat
Your ho got  cheeks
Sapphire theses diamonds
Chanel leggings, her ass
This what I got from rhyming (Damn)
Cars, clothes and cash
But that's something I been had (Ayy)
But that's something you don't know (Ayy)
Ever since I was a kid I knew that money was the move (The move)
All black wrist with the ice on it
Cut food ice, put the syrup on it
And that bitch top me off with the condom on it
She a good girl, I got a lot of money
Cold blows on these niggas
My chain like fourteen figures
My neck can't hold it either
Your check can't hold her either
Nigga, that’s a two seater
Rolling up that illegal
 feel from that litre, I’m faded
She undressing for a impression
My suggestion is that you come towards my direction
And catch some of this lesson
Water in my glass hoe, chillin' like I should, though (Carti)
Won’t catch me in the club (Club), making it rain
For these broke hoes (Hell no), that's a no no (Hell no)
Catch me when them clouds come from , hoe (Ayy)
Catch me when them clouds come from , hoe (Bitch)
Catch me when them clouds come from , hoe
Bitch, all you niggas bitches

Get down, in her nightgown
She get down (Shake that ass)
Ass out, Louis pouch
Filled with loud, she hold dope (That dope)
Before we fuck we smoke (We smoke, yeah)

Open your legs wide, close the bush
I'm on cloud 9 the way I hit it from behind (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

JC
I'm just, I'm just (makin')
Dead hoes, now wait
Hustle and aesthetic based
When the golden boys hit the corner
Scavengers surround the place
Even when I was saying grace they did that shit for satans sake
Thinking he can help, seen my niggas sent to heavens gates
Never heard of AK
Never had the time to play until the neighbors leave
Trans fool bitch it's time to skate
Tram to the devil it's the only time life makes sense
Fuck with the zombie you'll get redder than a white bitch
It's like my world is the residence
Life can be so pleasant when you living that shit reckless
Living that shit reckless

Corduroys on a golden boy
Supreme team with gold blings
Signatures on they wings
Parachute bags, brass knuckles and knick knacks
Pockets full of cheddar and empty dime bags
Rollin up the hash with the fellas
Higher than ever
I dead 'em all where's the shovel?
Zombie Gang to the other
Thats my brother JC
Just raised from another
Thats my nigga though we bringing bitches to the condo
I think they kinda shy though
It's still all good though
They say they from Toronto
I would have thought Chicago
They say they tryna smoke some
I say, Bitch, shake that ass though
Weed got me fucked up
Can you please try to take it slow?
Hold up, you grab my pants try to see what your working with
You do too much
I'm just trying to fuck so whatchu sayin'?
Dont be playin'
I dont like to be upset too much
You blowin my high you tryna chill or what? (What)
Hahahaha

Весь твій трапчік перетворити в могилу
Занадто довго тримаєш блант
Передай його мені, мені він потрібен більше
Нигга, ти зайдеш до мене в проект
І на хвилину вилетиш промоклим
Ти може чето там і куриш
Але у моїй крю косяк завжди товстіший
Кручу швидше, ніж Боря дроче
Расенган, у мене 9 хвостів є
А, а, я, кеш
