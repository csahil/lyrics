God never let my enemies get between insanity and Hova
Turning clouds into castles and pan slow cameras roll
These bitches listen to us like we got mind control
Overdose my high nigga, Im flying
By the jets shout out the sky nigga, Im dying
I take a pound and break it down into a baby bud
Roll up a spliff, then I light it up, now take a puff
It takes concentration when Im blazing on this elevation
Now treat your hate with my herbal medication
Yeah nigga, true statement
You smoking reefers

No, Sam, I cant
Come on, Dewey
Join the party

You dont want this
Get out of here
You know what
I dont want no hangover

It doesnt give you a hangover
Well, I get addicted to it or something

I dont wanna overdose on it
You cant OD on it
Its not gonna make me wanna have sex, is it
It makes sex even better
Sounds kinda expensive
Its the cheapest drug there is

State of mind, TMZ, fuck enemies, I skateboard with Zombies

When the shark speak, Im a showboat
On a jet ski rockin SBs, rockin Tommy
Fendi belt where the 9 be
Blowin hella smoke, where your soul go
Where your spirit at
Gettin cash bitch, I gotta have shit
I got cheetah print on my Pumas bitch
My lungs black, my brain pink
Swisher guts, leave evidence
That Ive bent over and fucked your bitch
Im an asshole, I might take your ho
So dont bring your ho in my presence
Graveyard my residence
Zombie broads give me neck and shit
Pulled off with the top off
Let the smoke clear

Cold weather, North Face
All black, Cartier yeah
I do what I can, Im the fuckin man
Man, ask your bitch, she a fuckin fan
