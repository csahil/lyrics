Up on the hill, people never stare
They just dont care
Chinese music under banyan trees
Here at the dude ranch above the sea
Aja, when all my dime dancin is through
I run to you
Up on the hill, theyve got time to burn
Theres no return
Double helix in the sky tonight
Throw out the hardware, lets do it right
Aja, when all my dime dancin is through
I run to you
Up on the hill, they think Im okay
Or so they say
Chinese music always sets me free
Angular banjoes sound good to me
Aja, when all my dime dancin is through
I run to you
Im working on gospel time these days
(the summer  this could be the cool part of the summer)
The sloeeyed creature in the reckless room shes so severe
A wise child walks right out of here
Im so excited I can barely cope
Im sizzling like an isotope
Im on fire so cut me some slack
First shes way gone then she comes back
Shes all business then shes ready to play
Shes almost gothic in a natural way
This house of desire is built foursquare
(the city  the cleanest kitten in the city)
When she speaks its like the slickest song I ever heard
Im hanging on her every word
As if Im not already blazed enough
She hits me with the cryptic stuff
Thats her style  to jerk me around
First shes all feel then she cools down
Shes pure science with a splash of black cat
Shes almost gothic and I like it like that
This dark place so thrilling and new
Its kind of like the opposite of an aerial view
Unless Im totally wrong
I hear her rap and brother its strong
Im pretty sure that what shes telling me is mostly lies
But I just stand there hypnotized
Ill just have to make it work somehow
Im in the amen corner now
Its called love  I spell L U V
First shes all buzz then shes noisefree
Shes bubbling over then theres nothing to say
Shes almost gothic in a natural way
Shes old school then shes like young
Little eva meets the bleecker street brat
Shes almost gothic but its better than that
Daytime youre too proud to brag about the badge you wore
Nighttime youre too tired to drag your chains across the floor
All your guns are gone Im told or in the aerodrome
Did you die the day they sold the ones you left at home?
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Whos to know if you take a dive?
Aint life grand in the Android Warehouse?
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find
That youre alive
That youre alive
Did you really gobble up the things they claim you ate?
Were you fit to swallow it or scared to clean your plate?
Have you tried to calculate the hours theyd applaud?
I would guess its somewhat less for just another fraud
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Whos to know if you take a dive?
Aint life grand in the Android Warehouse?
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find
That youre alive
That youre alive
That youre alive
I never seen you looking so bad, my funky one
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone
Any major dude with half a heart, surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it wont be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
Have you ever seen a squonks tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times
Any major dude with half a heart, surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it wont be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you cant hide from whats inside of you
Any major dude with half a heart, surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it wont be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
I never seen you looking so bad, my funky one
You tell me that your super fine mind has come undone
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend

If I had my way I would move to another lifetime
Id quit my job ride the train through the misty night time
Ill be ready when my feet touch ground wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me then theyll have me
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I can hear your words when you speak of what you are and have seen
I can see your hand reaching out through a shining daydream
Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame, honey I will be there, yes Ill be there
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I got this thing inside me
Thats got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I cant explain away
I think Ill go to the park watch the children playing
Perhaps Ill find in my head what my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey, I will be there, yes Ill be there
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
If I had my way
I would move to another lifetime
Id quit my job
Ride the train through
The misty nighttime
Id be ready when my feet touch ground
Wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me
Then theyll have me
Any world that Im welcome to (I say)
Any world that Im welcome to
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I can hear your words
When you speak of what
You are and have seen
I can see your hand
Reaching out through
A shining daydream
Where the days and nights
Are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame
Honey, I will be there
Yes, Ill be there
Any world that Im welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that Im welcome to
(Yes, Im talking bout any world)
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I got this thing inside me
Thats got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I cant explain away
I think Ill go to the park
Watch the children playing
Perhaps Ill find in my head
What my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey, I will be there
Yes, Ill be there
Any world that Im welcome to
(Its no lie)
Any world that Im welcome to
(Yes, Im talking bout any world)
Any world that Im welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

Drive west on Sunset to the sea
Turn that jungle music down
Just until were out of town
This is no one night stand
Its a real occasion
Close your eyes and youll be there
Its everything they say
The end of a perfect day
Distant lights from across the bay
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me Im the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again
Well jog with show folk on the sand
Drink kirschwasser from a shell
San Francisco show and tell
Well I should know by now
That its just a spasm
Like a Sunday in TJ
That its cheap but its not free
That Im not what I used to be
And that loves not a game for three
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me Im the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again
My friends say no dont go
For that cotton candy
Son youre playing with fire
The kid will live and learn
As he watches his bridges burn
From the point of no return
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me Im the only one
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
Five names that I can hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isnt here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard
Yes Im going insane
And Im laughing in the frozen rain
Well Im so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Pi√±a Colada, my friend
Stompin on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
You fellah, you tearin up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think that I dont see
That ditch out in the valley
That theyre digging just for me?
Yes Im going insane
You know Im laughing at the frozen rain
Well I feel like Im so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Pi√±a Colada, my friend
Stompin on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
You know, going insane
Yes Im laughing at the frozen rain
And Im so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Pi√±a Colada, my friend
Stompin on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
Im not one to look behind, I know that times must change
But over there in Barrytown, they do things very strange
And though youre not my enemy
I like things like they used to be
And though youd like some company
Im standing by myself
Go play with someone else
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
Dont believe Im taken in by stories I have heard
I just read the Daily News and swear by every word
And dont think that Im out of line
For speaking out for what is mine
Id like to see you do just fine
But look at what you wear
And the way you cut your hair
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
In the beginning we recall that the word was hurled
Barrytown people got to be from another world
Leave me or Ill be just like the others you will meet
They wont act as kindly if they see you on the street
And dont you scream or make a shout
Its nothing you can do about
It was there when you came out
Its a special lack of grace
I can see it in your face
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
In the corner of my eye
I saw you in Rudys
You were very high
You were high
It was a cryin disgrace
They saw your face
On the counter by your keys
Was a book of numbers
And your remedies
One of these
Surely will screen out the sorrow
But where are you tomorrow
I cant cry anymore
While you run around
(While you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That its over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
Down to Greene Street
There you go
Lookin so outrageous
And they tell you so
You should know
How all the pros play the game?
Then you change your name
Like a gangster on the run
You will stagger homeward
To your precious one
Im the one
Who must make everything right
Talk it out till daylight
I dont care anymore
Why you run around
(Why you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That its over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
I cant cry anymore
While you run around
(While you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That its over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
So outrageous
So outrageous
So outrageous
When Black Friday comes
Ill stand down by the door
And catch the grey men when they
Dive from the fourteenth floor
When Black Friday comes
Ill collect everything Im owed
And before my friends find out
Ill be on the road
When Black Friday falls
You know its got to be
Dont let it fall on me
When Black Friday comes
Ill fly down to Muswellbrook
Gonna strike all the big red words
From my little black book
Gonna do just what I please
Gonna wear no socks and shoes
With nothing to do but feed
All the kangaroos
When Black Friday comes
Ill be on that hill
You know I will
When Black Friday comes
Im gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it
til I satisfy my soul
Gonna let the world pass by me
The Archbishops gonna sanctify me
And if he dont come across
Im gonna let it roll
When Black Friday comes
Im gonna stake my claim
Ill guess Ill change my name
I was scrapin bottom
Groping in the dark
It takes a crusty punk to really beat
The mean streets of Medicine Park
So I shifted left and out of town
Then I clicked my heels and I doubled down to
Blues Beach, Im frying
Sizzling in the merciful rays
And its the long sad Sunday of the early resigned
I went to Central Station
To catch that early bus
They were gassed and runnin in every which way
But unhappily not for us
Here come Trina‚Äîthe child bride
I said hey pretty girl‚Äîcan I cop a ride to
Blues beach, its raining
Im chilling at the Manatee Bar
Well its a stone soul picnic for the early resigned
We can rent a paranymphic glider
My hypothetical friend
And we could sail away to the bending end
Grab Big Dog a blanket
Angel of my heart
Things may get a whole lot worse
Before suddenly falling apart
Give your roommate Yvonne a ring
Cause if she still wants in I gotta pull some strings
On Blues Beach, Im dying
Freezin in the merciful rays
And its the long sad Sunday of the early resigned
Bodhisattva, would you take me by the hand
Bodhisattva, would you take me by the hand
Can you show me the shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your China, can you show me
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Im gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva
Im gonna sell my house in town
And Ill be there to shine in your Japan
To sparkle in your China, yes Ill be there
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, would you take me by the hand
Bodhisattva, would you take me by the hand
Can you show me the shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your China, can you show me
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Im gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva
Im gonna sell my house in town
And Ill be there to shine in your Japan
To sparkle in your China, yes Ill be there
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Look out!
Bye and bye now
Well get over
The things weve done and the things we said
But not just now when
I can t remember
Exactly what it was I thought we had
cause I waited so long girl and I came so far
To find out youre not always who you say you are
And theres a star in the book of liars by your name
Santa claus came in late last night
Drunk on christmas wine
Fell down hard in the driveway
Hung his bag out on the laundry line
Theres a cobra gunship for his golden boy
And theres a hello kitty for his pride and joy
And a silver star in the book of liars by your name
They hung a star in the book of liars by your name
Stars imploding
The long night passing
Electrons dancing in the frozen crystal dawn
Heres one left stranded at the zero crossing
With a hole in its halflife left to carry on
But now the worlds much larger than it looks today
And if my bad luck ever blows me back this way
Then Ill just look in my book of liars for your name
Ill just look in the book of liars for your name

Take the worst of this quirky world
Roll it up in a ball
Add the hair of a gogo girl
Turn it into a dance thats called
The bloody
Brain Tap Shuffle
Lose your mind
Youll see the oceans part
Youll think your goin blind
You can talk about your daily grind
While shell dish out the soft shoe
If makin money doesnt suit your mind
Weve got something here
Here for you
You can sit there and suck your thumb
Hear the rock and roll hum
But youre just a crazy wall flower
Til you join all your friends on the floor
And do the
Brain Tap Shuffle
Lose your mind
Youll see the oceans part
Youll think your goin blind
Take your clothes off and start to shake
Shake rattle and roll
Watch the walls and the ceiling quake
Let it move your body and soul
And do the
Brain Tap Shuffle
Lose your mind
Youll see the oceans part
Youll think your goin blind

A race of angels bound with one another
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock
His golf at noon for free
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
His ladys aching to bring a body down
She daily preaches on where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen
A face we all have seen
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
A case of aces done up loose for dealing
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose
And power enough to choose
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Some turn out, a hundred grand
Get with it, well shake his hand
Dont bother to understand
Dont question the little man
Be part of the brotherhood
Yes its, chain lightning
It feels so good
Hush brother, we cross the square
Act natural like you dont care
Turn slowly and comb your hair
Dont trouble the midnight air
Were standing just where he stood
It was chain lightning
It feels so good
If you listen, you can hear it
Its the laughter in the street
Its the motion in the music
And the fire beneath your feet
All the signs are right this time
You dont have to try so very hard
If you live in this world
Youre feelin the change of the guard
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
All you cowboys and your neighbors
Can you swallow up your pride?
Take your guns off, if youre willin
And you know were on your side
If you wanna get thru the years
Its high time you played your card
If you live in this world
Youre feelin the change of the guard
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
If you wanna get thru the years
Its high time you played your card
If you live in this world
Youre feelin the change of the guard
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own
Three weighed ounce pure golden ring, no precious stone
Five nights without a bite, no place to lay his head
And if nobody takes him in hell soon be dead
On the street he spied my face, I heard him hail
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale
Poor man, he showed his hand, so righteous was his need
And me so wise I bought his prize for chicken feed
Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind
Poor kid, he overdid, embraced the spreading haze
And while he sighed his body died in fifteen ways
When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay
Round his arm the plastic tag read DOA
Yes Jack, I gave it back, the ring I could not own
Now come, my friend, Ill take your hand and lead you home
I dont like waiting for a knock on the door
I dont like wondering why
I got no mercy for a man and his tears
Hes just living a lie
I got a feeling like Im losing my cool
Thats no way to be
You got me crying, got me playing the fool
Thats what youre doing to me
Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I dont want to say how long its been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I dont want to live alone again
My old man never told me how
I dont like lying all alone in my bed
Nobody calling my name
I cant say thank you for a kick in the head
But I need you just the same
See me settin by the side of the road
People starin and smilin
They got no mercy for a man and his tears
Cant you hear me cryin?
Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I dont want to say how long its been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I dont want to live alone again
My old man never told me how
You gotta come back baby
I dont want to say how long its been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I dont want to live alone again
My old man never told me how
Well Ive kicked around a lot since high school
Ive worked a lot of nowhere gigs
From keyboard man in a rocknska band
To haulin boss crude in the big rigs
Now Ive come back home to plan my next move
From the comfort of my Aunt Fayes couch
When I see my little cousin Janine walk in
All I could say was owowouch
Honey how youve grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
She turned my life into a living hell
In those little tops and tight capris
I pretended to be readin the National Probe
As I was watchin her wax her skis
On Saturday night she walked in with her date
And backs him up against the wall
I tumbled off the couch and heard myself sing
In a voice I never knew I had before
Honey how youve grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
Ill teach you everything I know
If you teach me how to do that dance
Life is short and quid pro quo
And whats so strange about a downhome family romance?
One night were playin gin by a cracklin fire
And I decided to make my play
I said, babe with my boyish charm and good looks
How can you stand it for one more day?
She said, maybe its the skeevy look in your eyes
Or that your mind has turned to applesauce
The dreary architecture of your soul
I said but what is it exactly turns you off?
Honey how youve grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree

I lived in no holy house but the Grand Hotel
The back streets of this old town I know so well
And I drunk of no holy wine save muscatel
Now my friend, Ive got to go
You tell everyone I know
Im sayin goodbye, bye, bye, Dallas
I cant stay
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Bye, bye, Dallas got to go
And I remember when they told me so
Right now Im wonderin where
The good times have gone
All the things I never loved when they was mine
Hot city and an empty pocket make a man think on
Ive been living low so long
Gotta get back where I belong
Bye, bye, Dallas
I cant stay
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Hey no farther
Livin undercover dont do no good
Bye, bye, Dallas
This is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
Thats all in the past
You call me a fool
You say its a crazy scheme
This ones for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
Ill make it this time
Im ready to cross that fine line
Learn to work the saxophone
I, Ill play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
Ill rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
Ill make it my home sweet home
Learn to work the saxophone
I, Ill play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
Ill be what I want to be
Ill learn to work the saxophone
I, Ill play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)
Times are hard
Youre afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin
Cause your man is out of town
Thats the time you get me runnin
And you know Ill be around
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I dont wanna do your dirty work no more
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I dont wanna do your dirty work no more
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I dont wanna do your dirty work no more
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I dont wanna do your dirty work no more
Im a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I dont wanna do your dirty work no more
Katy tried, I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side
Of no tomorrow
You walked in, and my life began again
Just when Id spent the last
Piaster I could borrow
All night long
We would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang
I knew was true
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy, are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me Doctor
Dont seem right
Ive been strung out here all night
Ive been waiting for the taste
You said youd bring to me
Biscayne Bay, where the Cuban
Gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies, you can see it in her eyes
But imagine my surprise
When I saw you
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
She is lovely yes shes sly
And youre an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
In the mornin you go gunnin
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in
But they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all sangin
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isnt hangin
And they put you on the street
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again
When you know shes no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And youre sure youre near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know shes smilin
Youll be on your knees tomorrow
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again
Now you swear and kick and beg us
That youre not a gambling man
Then you find youre back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when youre able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again
I hear you found a brand new friend
Well, if I try to take you back again
If I decide to make amends
Dont let me in
You know, Id like to be inside
But dont you listen when you hear me cry
Not even just to say goodbye
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
Dont let me in
Hey, I never want to do you harm
Dont pay no head to all my false alarms
If I should come with pleading arms
Dont let me in
You hear a knocking on your door
The pounding of a heart you cant ignore
But soon it isnt there no more
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
I say no, no, no, no, oh noooo
Dont let me in
In case youre wondering its alive and well
That little habit that you left with me
Here in the suburbs where its hard to tell
If I got the bear or if the bear got me
How did you know that it would take me down
Down to the bottom of the wine dark sea
Where you were waiting there to bring me round
Where you knew all the dopest cuts to be
Drowned at the bottom of your mystery
Down in the bottom of the wine dark sea
Saw your old lady in the park today
The legendary smile is wearing thin
Behind that guessing game you make her play
Now that she knows that she could never win
I guess youre never gonna take her down
Down to the bottom of your little black heart
Lay with her naked on the cool hard ground
To watch the sun rise in the dopest part
Down in the bottom where your lifeline shows
Down in the bottom where nobody goes
Did you loose your way find another
Did you make your play or just run for cover
Is its safe to say you got burned today?
I like the feathers and I love the hat
I like that little gypsy tune youre humming
I guess Im happy now weve had this chat
Oh yeah Im really glad I saw you coming
There in the corner of the eastern sky
The tortured angel of your rising sign
Darkens the evening with his one good eye
An evil omen of the dopest kind
Down in the bottom where your demons fly
Down in the bottom of the eastern sky
Down in the bottom where your lifeline shows
Down in the bottom where nobody goes
Drowned at the bottom of your mystery
Down in the bottom of the wine dark sea
Kids if you want some fun
Mr LaPage is your man
Hes always laughing, having fun
Showing his films in the den
Come on, come on
Soon you will be eighteen
I think you know what I mean
Dont tell your mama
Your daddy or mama
Theyll never know where you been
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Listen to what I say
He wants to show you the way
Right down the hallway with open arms
To teach you a new game to play
Come on, come on
Soon it will be too late
Bobbing for apples can wait
I know youre used to sixteen or more
Sorry we only have eight
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Oh, babies come on
(Please) come on
Kids if you want some fun
See what you never have seen
Take off your cheaters
And sit right down
Start the projection machine
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Everyones gone to the movies
Now were alone at last
Its high time for a walk on the real side
Lets admit the bastards beat us
I move to dissolve the corporation
In a pool of margaritas
So lets switch off all the lights
Light up all the Luckies
Crankin up the afterglow
Cause were goin out of business
Everything must go
Talk about your major pain and suffering
Now our selfesteem is shattered
Show the world a mighty hideyho face
As we go sliding down the ladder
It was sweet up at the top
Til that ill wind started blowing
Now its cozy down below
Cause were goin out of business
Everything must go
We gave it our best shot
But keep in mind we got a lot
The sky, the moon, good food and the weather
Firstrun movies‚Äîdoes anybody get lucky twice?
Wouldnt it be nice
Tell me can you dig it Miss Fugazy
Now its gone from late to later
Frankly I could use a little face time
In the service elevator
And if Dave from Acquisitions
Wants to get in on the action
With his Handicam in tow
Well were goin out of business
Everything must go
Can it be the sorry sun is rising
Guess its time for us to book it
Talk about the famous road not taken
In the end we never took it
And if somewhere on the way
We got a few good licks in
No ones ever gonna know
Cause were goin out of business
Everything must go
Where did the bastard run?
Is he still around?
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby
Im gonna get a gun
Shoot the lover down
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby?
Traces are everywhere
In our happy home
Now you better tell me everything you did baby
I jumped out of my easy chair
It was not my own
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening
You know how people talk
I wonder what they say
I think you better tell me everything you did baby
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
You never came to me
When you were so inclined
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby
I know where babys at
I know your filthy mind
Now youre gonna do me everything you did baby
You did baby
I decline to walk the line
They tell me that Im lazy
Worldly wise, I realize
That everybodys crazy
A womans voice reminds me
To serve and not to speak
Am I myself or just another freak?
You know theres fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
Id love to run out now
Theres nowhere left to turn, no no
With a cough, I shake it off
And work around my yellow stripe
Should I hide or eat my pride?
Or wait until its good and ripe?
My life is boiling over
Its happened once before
I wish someone would open up the door
Dont you know theres fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
Id love to run out now
Theres nowhere left to turn
Dont you know
Theres fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
Id love to run out now
Theres nowhere left to turn
Yeah

One plush summer you come to me ripe and ready
And bad through and through
With that deep mystical soul synergy pumping steady
Between me and you
Lovin all the beautiful work weve done, cara mia
And its barely July
If we keep on boppin until Labor Day
Lil miz Abbie  bye bye
What will it be  some soothing herb tea?
That might be just the thing
Lets say we spike it with Dilaudid
Or else  maybe tonight a hand of solitaire
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
Its a luscious invention for three
One summer by the sea
With the long weekend thats comin up fast
Lets get busy
Theres just too much to do
That black mini looks just like the one shes been missin
Feels good on you
Theres a few items we need in town  allezvous girl
Theres no time to waste
Such as fresh cable and fifteen watt bulbs
Couple dozen  its a big old place
Lets keep it light  well do a fright night
With blood and everything
Some punky laughter from the kitchen
And then  a nice relaxing hand of solitaire
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
Its a luscious invention for three
One summer by the sea
You can choose the music
Ill set up my gear
Later on well chill and watch the fireworks from here
How can you knock this mighty spitelock
Check out the work itself
A mix of elegance and function
Thats right  a tweak or two and then shes out of here
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
Its a luscious invention for three
One summer by the sea
Just when I say
Boy we cant miss
You are golden
Then you do this
You say this guy is so cool
Snapping his fingers like a fool
One more expensive kissoff
Who do you think I am
Lord I know youre a special friend
But you dont seem to understand
We got heavy rollers
I think you should know
Try again tomorrow
Cant you see theyre laughing at me
Get rid of him
I dont care what you do at home
Would you care to explain
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
And your elevator shoes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome
What I tell you
Back down the line
Ill scratch your back
You can scratch mine
No he cant sleep on the floor
What do you think Im yelling for
Ill drop him near the freeway
Doesnt he have a home
Lord I know youre a special friend
But you refuse to understand
Youre a nasty schoolboy
With no place to go
Try again tomorrow
Dont tell me hell wait in the car
Look at you
Holding hands with the man from Rio
Would you care to explain
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
With the studs that match your eyes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome
605, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
Hes a crowd pleasing man
One on one
Hes schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard
Hes Jungle Jim, again
When its all over
Well make some calls from my car
Were a star
Its a glamour profession
The LA concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his Eurasian bride
On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is Fridays theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness
While they danced
Im the one
Its a glamour profession
(Im the one)
The LA concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
Thats my claim to fame
Jive Miguel
Hes in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight
At Mr Chows
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done
Im the one
Its a glamour profession
(Im the one)
The LA concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
In the beginning
We could hang with the dude
But its been too much of nothing
Of that stank attitude
Now they curse your name
And theres a bounty on your face
Its your own fault daddy
Godwhackers on the case
We track your almighty ass thru seven heaven worlds
Me, Slinky Redfoot
And our trusty angelgirls
And when the stars bleed out
That be the fever of the chase
You better get gone poppie
Godwhackers on the case
Be very very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history
Climb up the glacier
Across bridges of light
We sniff you, Big Tiger
In the forest of the night
Cause theres no escape
From the Rajahs of Erase
Better run run run
Godwhackers on the case
Be very, very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history
Yes we are the Godwhackers
Who rip and chop and slice
For crimes beyond imagining
Its time to pay the price
You better step back son
Give the man some whacking space
You know this might get messy
Godwhackers on the case
My coat is black and the moon is yellow
Here is where I get off
As you can see for yourself old girl in the Green Book
I tango down to the smoky lobby
My eyes adjust to the light
The new cashier looks like Jill St John
Can that be right?
Im rolling into the bar at Joeys
Theyre getting ready to close
Here she comes very Kiss Me Deadly?
My life, my love, my third hand rose
Flash ahead to a yummy playback
Just you and me in a room
Double dreaming a page at a time in the Green Book
The torso rocks and the eyes are keepers
Now whered we sample those legs?
Im thinking Marilyn 40 in the Green Book
I like the neon I love the music
Anachronistic but nice
The seamless segue from fun to fever
Its a sweet device
Im so in love with this dirty city
This crazy grid of desire
The festive icons along the way
The boardwalk, the lovers, the house on fire
Shes kind of cute but a little younger
Shes got the mood and the moves
Its kinda scary to dig yourself in the Green Book
Cold, daring
No flies on me
Sorry, angel
I must take what I see
Green earrings
I remember
The rings of rare design
I remember
The look in your eyes
I dont mind
Greek medallion
Sparkles when you smile
Sorry, angel
I get hungry like a child
Green earrings
I remember
The rings of rare design
I remember
The look in your eyes
I dont mind
I dont mind
Green earrings
I remember
The rings of rare design
I remember
The look in your eyes
I dont mind
I dont mind
Uptown
Its murder out in the street
Uptown
Its murder out in the street
Thats where I found my mandarin plum
Thats where youd be if you found one
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street
Since may
Theres trouble most every night
Where once we danced our sweet routine
It reeks of wine and kerosene
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street
Theres a special place for lovers
One we understand
There where neon bends in daylight sky
In that sunny room she soothes me
Cools me with her fan
Were drifting
A thousand years roll by
Lou chang
Her brother hes burning with rage
Lou chang
Her brother hes burning with rage
Id like to know whats on his mind
He says hey buddy youre not my kind
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street
Babs and Clean Willie were in love they said
So in love the preachers face turned red
Soon everybody knew the thing was dead
He shouts, she bites, they wrangle through the night, yeah
She go crazy
Got to make a getaway, Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce
She takes the taxi to the good hotel
Bon march√© as far as she can tell
She drinks the zombie from the cocoa shell
She feels alright, she get it on tonight, yeah
Mister driver
Take me where the music play, Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce
At the Grotto
In the greasy chair
Sits the Charlie with the lotion and the kinky hair
When she smiled, she said it all
The band was hot so
They danced the famous Merengue
Now we dolly back
Now we fade to black
Tearful reunion in the USA
Day by day those memories fade away
Some babies grow in a peculiar way
It changed, it grew, and everybody knew, yeah
Semimojo
Whos this kinky soandso? Papa go
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce
You told me once I was your pride and joy
I guess those days are dead and gone
You must have took me for some golden boy
You didnt know what you were taking on
It was a hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
Now all the angles have been played in threes
There isnt much that I can say
I know you gave your little heart to me
I guess I threw the thing away
It was a hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
Sometimes the truth is kind of hard to find
But dont you worry I can read your mind
And you dont have to tell me to my face
You put some other joker in my place
They dealt us houses full with the queens and kings
And now theyre calling out our bluff
cause you and me girl we had everything
But it just wasnt quite enough
Now thats a hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
You say the truth is gonna set me free
Like you might throw a dog a bone
I know youre thinking that the jokes on me
Another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case

Down at the Lido they welcome you
With sausage and beer
Klaus and The Rooster have been there too
But lately he spends his time here
Hangin with the Mayor and all his friends
And nobody cares
Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise
Blacked out on the stairs
CHORUS
Knock twice, rap with your cane
Feels nice, youre out of the rain
We got your skinny girl
Here at the Western World
Ruthie will give you the silver key
To open the red door
Lay down your Jackson and you will see
The sweetness youve been cryin for
In the night you hide from the madman
Youre longing to be
But it all comes out on the inside
Eventually
CHORUS
In the night you hide from the madman
Youre longing to be

Way back when, in 67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?
Hey Nineteen
No, we cant dance together
(We cant dance together)
No, we cant talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Hey Nineteen
Thats Retha Franklin
She dont remember the Queen of Soul
Its hard times befallen
The sole survivors
She thinks Im crazy
But Im just growing old
Hey Nineteen
No, we got nothing in common
(We cant dance together)
No, we cant talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Nice!
Sure looks good!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Skate a little lower, now
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
(Say it again)
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
No, we cant dance together
No, we cant talk at all
I know this super highway
This bright familiar sun
I guess that Im the lucky one
Who wrote that tired sea song
Set on this peaceful shore
You think youve heard this one before
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
She serves the smooth retsina
She keeps me safe and warm
Its just the calm before the storm
Call in my reservation
So long hey thanks my friend
I guess Ill try my luck again
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
Left New Hyde Park to hold my own in New York town
Groped in the dark until I faced the place where scallywags are found
Sharks and yoyos everywhere
Baby, you can take it from there
Now theres a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, theres a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride
Can you reveal the day he came, the day hell go
This way I feel the time is moving much too slow
When he passes by your tent
Youll be glad when night is spent
Now theres a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, theres a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride, ride
The shoes of my friend
They stomp his name into the ground
Lets not pretend
We know with all that fearsome sound
Following my frozen trail
Moving to the inside rail
Now theres a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, theres a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride, ride
Saddle up and ride (saddle up and ride)
Saddle up and ride (saddle up and ride)
Saddle up and ride (saddle up and ride)
Saddle up and ride (saddle up and ride)
Im working hard from mornin ‚Äòtil night
My shoulder bendin to the wheel
I get home, you start to run me down
How do you think it makes me feel?
Your lashin tongue, it hurts my soul
I start to thinkin and I lose control
Im not movin like I know I should
Or feelin like Id like to feel
And I spend my days just foolin around
I cant function, honey, when you run me down
Oh darlin, dont you run me down
I gotta make a little fortune
So I can bring it on home to you
Youre only hurtin yourself my friend
Treatin me the way you do
My hands are tied behind my back
Im drinking dinner from a paper sack
Every day is the fourth of july
And Im nothin but an april fool
Well, I spend my days just cruisin around
I cant function, honey, when you run me down
Oh darlin, dont you run me down
Im half a man with half a heart
I hear you laughin and I fall apart
Id like to put it on the table
But Im lost before I even start
You do me wrong and its bringing me down
My idle ways are the talk of the town
You make me feel like a donothing clown
I cant function, honey, when you run me down
Oh darlin, dont you run me down
Oh darlin, dont you run me down
(spoken)
Hey, dont you run me down darlin
Its not polite
In public!
In public?
Down there in front of Abraham & Strauss?
I seen it
I was a W, now Im an L
Somethin wrong with my
(spoken text)
(Might say a word first, but cant make it out???) Rock n roll
Theyre throwin a party for big Ida Lee
The man from the skyway, the Chinaman and me
Theres so much affection its making me crazy
Ive run out of reasons for keepin it neat
Everybodys laughin
Everybodys makin love
Ida Lee, its you Im thinkin of
Threw out the favors, the hooters and the hats
We put out the candle, oh, and then blew out the cat
Oh, my temperatures rising, were all on the chaise lounge
Big Ida Lee, shes nowhere to be found
Everybodys laughin
Everybodys makin love
Ida Lee, its you Im thinkin of
Everybodys laughin
Everybodys makin love
Ida Lee, its you Im thinkin of
They open the air shaft as Ida walks in
She comes up to me and whispers, Honey, where have you been?
Im stripping my gears, Im blowing my fuse
Cause Ida Lees giving me somewhat more than I can use
Solo
Fade

Undersea by rail
Ninety minutes from new york to paris
Well by seventysix well be A O K

What a glorious time to be free
Get your ticket to that wheel in space

Youll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky
You know weve got to win
Here at home well play in the city
Powered by the sun
Perfect weather for a streamlined world
Therell be spandex jackets one for everyone
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
On that train all graphite and glitter
Undersea by rail
Ninety minutes from new york to paris
(more leisure for artists everywhere)
A just machine to make big decisions
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision
Well be clean when their work is done
Well be eternally free yes and eternally young
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
Teddys rolling now most every night
Skatin backwards at the speed of light
Hes changed  in a thousand little ways
Hes changed  yes indeed
You know hes movin on metal, yes hes
Hanging tight with the Jack of Speed
Sheenas party  theres a case in point
That rightwing hooey sure stunk up the joint
Hes gone  he walks through the old routines
But hes gone  guaranteed
He may be sittin in the kitchen, but hes
Steppin out with the Jack of Speed
You maybe got lucky for a few good years
But theres no way back from there to here
Hes a one way rider
On the shriek express
And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less
He cant hear you honey  thats alright
Pack some things and head up into the light
Dont stop  hell be callin out your name
But dont stop when you hear him plead
You better move now little darlin or youll be
Trading fours with the Jack of Speed
It must have been my lucky Thursday
Your dad went on that spree
Before the crew could put out the fires
You hopped a bus for NYC
Down in Tampa the future looked desperate and dark
Now youre the wonderwaif of Gramercy Park
Who makes the morning fabulous?
Who says todays a fun day?
Why do I feel like sailing again?
Honey its you, Janie Runaway
Lets grab some takeout from Dean and Deluca
A hearty gulping wine
You be the showgirl, Ill be Sinatra
Way back in 59
Sweetness in heels, look at you in long black gloves
Come to Old Blue Eyes tell me, who do you love
Who makes the traffic interesting?
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who makes me feel like painting again?
Honey its you, Janie Runaway
Lets plan a weekend alone together
Out to Binkys place
The sugar shack in Pennsylvania
Or would that be a federal case?
Well take the Big Red, the Blazer, its nice inside
And guess whos coming along for the ride
Who has a friend named Melanie
Whos not afraid to try new things?
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain?
Possibly you, Janie Runaway
Who makes the morning fabulous?
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain?
Possibly you, Janie Runaway
Were gonna break out the hats and hooters
When Josie comes home
Were gonna rev up the motor scooters
When Josie comes home to stay
Were gonna park in the street
Sleep on the beach and make it
Throw down the jam till the girls say when
Lay down the law and break it
When Josie comes home
When Josie comes home
So good
Shes the pride of the neighborhood
Shes the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
Jo would you love to scrapple
Shell never say no, no!
Shine up the battle apple
Well shake em all down tonight
Were gonna mix in the street
Strike at the stroke of midnight
Dance on the bones till the girls say when
Pick up whats left by daylight
When Josie comes home
When Josie comes home
So bad
Shes the best friend we never had
Shes the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
When Josie comes home
So good
Shes the pride of the neighborhood
Shes the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
While the music played you worked by candlelight
Those San Francisco nights
You were the best in town
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl
You turned it on the world
Thats when you turned the world around
Did you feel like Jesus?
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home
Every AFrame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all
Youd go to LA on a dare
And youd go it alone
Could you live forever?
Could you see the day?
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead
This life can be very strange
All those DayGlo freaks who used to paint the face
Theyve joined the human race
Some things will never change
Son, you were mistaken
You are obsolete
Look at all the white men on the street
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Clean this mess up else well all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale
Just get it all out of here
Is there gas in the car
Yes, theres gas in the car
I think the people down the hall
Know who you are
Careful what you carry
Cause the man is wise
You are still an outlaw in their eyes
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne, (get along)
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Kind Spirit dont go
Tell me why
The time has come to fly on by
Kind Spirit dont go
Such as shame
The room wont be the same
Dont leave me here to fade without your flame
Hello one and all
Was it you I used to know?
Cant you hear me call
On this old ham radio
All I got to say
Im alive and feeling fine
Should you come my way
You can share my poison wine
No marigolds in the promised land
Theres a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know
I wont take your bread
I dont need no helping hand
I cant be no savage
I cant be no highwayman
Show me where you are
You and I will spend this day
Drivin in my car
Through the ruins of Santa Fe
No marigolds in the promised land
Theres a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know
Im reading last years papers
Although I dont know why
Assassins, cons and rapers
Might as well die
When you come around
No more pain and no regrets
Watch the sun go brown
Smoking cobalt cigarettes
Theres no need to hide
Taking things the easy way
If I stay inside
I might live till Saturday
No marigolds in the promised land
Theres a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
King of the world, as far as I know
Now they lay his body down
Sad old men who run this town
I still recall the way
He led the charge and saved the day
Blue blood and rain
I can hear the bugle playin
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John, oh
While he plundered far and wide
All his starving children cried
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John
Raise up your glass to good King John
Raise up your glass to good King John
Whats this fierce new change?
Has your juggernaut reached my door?
Am I out of range?
Think another thought before
Babies are ground up in the last big roundup
Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind
Piggy bank, ooooowhee
If its Heavensent youll go far
Listen well to me
Smoke that seven cent cigar
Can that rumba and Avogadros Number
Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind
Polaroid galore
Snap my jelly roll, count your change
For your midnight chore
Play that sellyoursoul exchange
Menthol filter tip danglin from your nether lip
Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind
If John Doe writes another book
With words that just wont quit
Why must I forge through it?
Let George do it
I remember Christmas morning back in 1954
When we moved her to Mount Savage as if it mattered anymore
Mama always said
How the air can clear her head
We were colder and much higher than we ever were before
I recall her tailored jersey and the flowers that she wore
Years ago I tried to tell her
What was in my heart
But she was part of the city
(She took a little with sugar) She took a little with sugar
(She took the money from my old man) She took the money from my old man
(She took a little with sugar) Ohhhh yes she did
(She took the money from my old man)
All the years that she was with us you could count them on one hand
I was taken with her showboat style, but too young to understand
She was all alone
Ahead of her time
She was first generation
(She took a little with sugar) She took a little with sugar
(She took the money from my old man) She took the money from my old man
(She took a little with sugar) Ohhhh yes she did
(She took the money from my old man)
(Took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar) She took the money from my old man
(She took the money from my old man) She took a little with sugar
(She took the money from my old man) Ohhhh, She took the money from my old man
(She took the money from my old man) Ohhhh yes she did
(She took the money from my old man) I said
(She took a little with sugar) She took a little with sugar
(She took a little with sugar) Ohhhh, she took the money from my old man
(She took a little with sugar) Ohhhh yes she did
(She took a little with sugar) She took the money from my old man
(She took the money from my old man) The money from my old man
(She took the money from my old man) Ohhhh yes she did
(She took the money from my old man) She took a little with sugar
(She took the money from my old man) Ohhhhhhhh
(She took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar)
(She took a little with sugar) Money from my old man
(She took the money from my old man) She took a little with sugar
(She took the money from my old man) She took the money from my old man
That must be her again
Shes leaning on my bell
That cold psychotic brain
The one I know so well
So Im nailed to the floor in the nooption zone
Theres about zero chance shell give up and go home
This endless afternoon
It started on the day I met her
Lunch with Gina is forever
Shes coming round the corner
Her bodys just a blur
I peel out like The Flash
It dont mean boo to her
So I duck into Ninos‚Äîshes barred from the place
The minute I walk out shes right in my face
Shes got nothing but time
No use in trying to be clever
Lunch with Gina is forever
Now Im in my apartment
The blinds down the lights out
The phone rings God help me
Theres nobody home
I crouch on the carpet
Not breathing just being
Like meat on the bone
Im in a cozy booth
Maybe my watch is fast
Another Tanqueray
Ill wait till twenty past
Im about to go postal when she waltzes in
I guess shes a knockout‚Äîhey where have I been?
The waiter never comes
God knows the service could be better
Lunch with Gina is forever
Coffee and a kiss
Maybe later maybe never
Lunch with Gina
Thelonious, my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that youre here again
For one more time
Let your madness run with mine
Streets still unseen, well find somehow
No time is better than now
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
The world that we used to know
People tell me it dont turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that aint smiling like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear weve been waiting too long
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
Tell me where are you driving, midnight cruiser?
Will you walk a little faster? said a whiting to a snail
Theres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my tail
Dont you see how eagerly the turtles and the lobsters all advance
They are waiting on the shingle, wont you come and join the dance?
Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance?
(3x)
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters in the sea
But the snail replied Too far, too far! and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance
(Chorus)
(2x)
(Solo)
What matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied
There is another shore, you know, upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance
(Chorus)
(repeat to fade)
I got one and you want four
Its so hard to help you
I cant keep up with you no more
And you treat me like its a sin
But you cant lock me in
You want me here with you right to the end
No thank you my friend
I fear the monkey in your soul
Wont you turn that bebop down?
I cant hear my heart beat
Wheres that fatback chord I found?
But honey dont you think it was wrong
To interrupt my song?
Ill pack my things and run so far from here
Goodbye dear
I fear the monkey in your soul
Dont you think it was wrong
To interrupt my song?
Ill pack my things and run so far from here
Goodbye dear
I fear the monkey in your soul
I fear the monkey in your soul
(vocalizing)
The fish are flying in the county seat
The cops are searching for a missing beat
And Billy Burroughs, is he still on the nod?
Deal with the girlfriend, not a demigod
But be assured that if this shaken world is sucked into the sun
More to come
Theres more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
More to come
Theres more to come
The ladies sure look like theyre craving for me
But aint that just what theyre supposed to be?
I hear the man is moving in next door
The boys will have to use the second floor
You might have answers I can understand, but I know only one
More to come
Yeah, more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
More to come
Yeah, more to come
The kids have torn a yellow packard apart
Aint that enough to break a rich mans heart?
I see the rats have found the cradle again
Ill let you know if I remember when
Theres one conclusion that I must defend, its where we started from
Ho! More to come
Yeah, more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
Ohhh, more to come
More to come
I remember the thirtyfive sweet goodbyes
When you put me on the Wolverine
Up to Annandale
It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair
I said oh no
William and Mary wont do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And Im never going back
To my old school
Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon theyre gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I cant stand her
Doing what she did before
Leaving like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale
Well I hear the whistle but I cant go
Im gonna take her down to Mexico
She said whoa no
Guadalajara wont do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And Im never going back
To my old school
California tumbles into the sea
Thatll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I cant seem to get to you
Through the US Mail
Well I hear the whistle but I cant go
Im gonna take her down to Mexico
She said oh no
Guadalajara wont do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And Im never going back
To my old school
The wind was driving in my face
The Smell of Prickly Pear
(My rival, show me my rival)
The milk truck eased into my space
Somebody screamed somewhere
I struck a match against the door
Of Anthonys Bar and Grill
I was the whining stranger
A fool in love
With time to kill
Ive got detectives on his case
They filmed the whole charade
(My rival, show me my rival)
Hes got a scar across his face
He wears a hearing aid
Sure, hes a Jolly roger
Until he answers for his crimes
Yes, Ill match him whim for whim now
I still recall when I first held
Your tiny hand in mine
(My rival, show me my rival)
I loved you more than I can tell
But now its stomping time
Sure hes a Jolly roger
Until he answers for his crimes
Yes, Ill match him whim for whim now
I came a long long way from home
I travelled far just to be here today
Across an endless sea of salty tears
Behind the divided line of eighteen years
You gotta walk that road alone
You gotta walk that lonely
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
A sight you surely must have spied by now
I admit that I dont even know your name
I feel like I could know you all the same
Are you gonna walk that road with me sometime
Or is it gonna be that lonely
Are you gonna walk that road with me this time
Dont make me be that lonely
Its still no easy thing to hold your head up high
When every time you turn around
Somebody kicks your statue down
I tried my best to hold my ground
I swore Id never let it be this way
But now I broke my sword, dropped my gun
Just like some tragic beat napoleon
Now I gotta walk that road again
Now I gotta walk that lonely
Now I gotta walk that road one time
Now I gotta be that lonely
What with no better way to go
As long as Im still kicking that gong around
I see this time I met my match in you
I know now that you are my waterloo
My waterloo
Shes lost  shes late
Shes zooming on a couch somewhere
Or high  or home
Im not supposed to call her there
I wait  I smoke
I stare into my coke
Its happening again
I tell myself that its over and done, amen
Her skin  like milk
Its like shes never seen the sun
Some hearts to crunch
Is more like her idea of fun
I know  shes ill
Im cruising for a spill
Im hanging just the same
I need to be in the heat
Of her cold white flame
Another negative girl
At the edge of the frame
Deliciously toxic
The original classic thing  more of the same
Shes in the zone
Crying on the phone
I need you here
Im on the street again
Staggering out into the burn of the brain dead dawn
To arrive in time to find her gone
Shes on the train
To somewhere up by Fordham Road
Her reptile brain
Locked down and ready in combat mode
Some cash  a key
This guy she has to see
A doctor friend uptown
And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down
Another negative girl
Spinning out of the frame
Exquisitely limpid
The original classic thing  more of the same
A goof  a buzz
If that is what it was
Then how do you explain
The way she looks when shes
Dragging me out to dance with her
In the summer rain
Another negative girl
At the edge of the frame
Exhausting and luscious
The original classic thing  more of the same
Its a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain
But dont tell it to a poor man
Cause hes got to kill for every thrill
The best he can
Everywhere around me
I see jealousy and mayhem
Because no men have all their peace of mind
To carry them
Well I dont really care
If its wrong or if its right
But until my ship comes in
Ill live night by night
When the joker tried to tell me
I could cut it in this rube town
When he tried to hang that sign on me
I said Take it down
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice
Theyre gonna do it with a shotgun
Yes, Im cashing in this tencent life
For another one
Well I aint got the heart
To lose another fight
So until my ship comes in
Ill live night by night
Well I dont really care
If its wrong or if its right
But until my ship comes in
Ill live night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by night
When Im sure youre gone at last
I make believe that I have no past
I make good cheer and wipe away all the tears
I take another room, find another friend
And when I feel that youre not real I stop and then
Oh wow its you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow its you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why dont you disappear?
This hotel had a view
One brick wall and shades of blue
I paid my bill and started over again
I flipped another penny, counted up to ten
I leter rip just like a gypsy dog and then
Oh wow its you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow its you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why dont you disappear?
In this warm and foreign place
Theres not one familiar face
It seems this time Ive left myself far behind
I write another letter I know Ill never send
I lock the door and walk out for some air and then
Oh wow its you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow its you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why dont you disappear?
I heard them whispering
I saw their eyes, their jests
Their secret smiles
Dance a wild new tango
Overrun the great placenta
And who received the first bangbang?
It was the whole goddamned gang
What can the price for freedom be?
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, dont hesitate
The old regime is falling
Who got the bottles?
Who got the ladies fashions
And the tray?
Did you get the radio?
Did you get the princess collar?
Well dont you know I got the cheap
So what you got youd better keep
But that brunette, she comes with me
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, dont hesitate
The old regime is falling
Gotta get a move on
Whats in your hand?
Its just my things left in the sand
Now Ill drive with four wheel drive
Air in the breadbox
Cheese in the mouths of babes
Is fine with me
Yes Im on your side
Deal me in and do your preaching
But wont you carve the turkey now?
I know Ive earned my share somehow
By morning who knows where Ill be?
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, dont hesitate
The old regime is falling
A world become one of salads and sun
Only a fool would say that
A boy with a plan, a natural man
Wearing a white Stetson hat
Unhand that gun begone
Theres no one to fire upon
If hes holding it high
Hes telling a lie
I heard it was you
Talking bout a world where all is free
It just couldnt be
And only a fool would say that
The man in the street dragging his feet
Dont wanna hear the bad news
Imagine your face there at his place
Standing inside his brown shoes
You do his nine to five
Drag yourself home half alive
And there on the screen
A man with a dream
I heard it was you
Talking bout a world where all is free
It just couldnt be
And only a fool would say that
Anybody on the street
Has murder in his eyes
You feel no pain
And youre younger than you realize
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool
I heard it was you
Talking bout a world where all is free
It just couldnt be
And only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation
Its Parkers band with a smooth style of syncopation
Kansas city born and growing, you wont believe what the boys are blowing
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parkers band
Youll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo
Youll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo
Suddenly the music hits you, its a bird in flight that just cant quit you
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parkers band
We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance
Me and you will listen to a little bit of what made the preacher dance
Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection
And if you cant fly youll have to move in with the rhythm section
Either way youre bound to function, 52nd Streets the junction
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parkers
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parkers
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parkers band
On the water down in New Orleans
My babys the pearl of the quarter
Shes a charmer like you never seen
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
Where the sailor spends his hardearned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
And if you hear from my Louise
Wont you tell her I said hello
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shrine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
She loved the million dollar words I say
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
She said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
And if you hear from my Louise
Wont you tell her I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
And if you hear from my Louise
Wont you tell her I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
Ive seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
Its like a dream come true
So wont you smile for the camera
I know theyre gonna love it
Peg
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know Ill love you better
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
Its your favorite foreign movie
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know Ill love you better
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
Its your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
Its your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
Its your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
Its your favorite foreign movie
Our man Abu squeezes off 20 tracer rounds
And thats when she jumps the turnstile
And as she clings to the roof of the speeding train
The Double A down to Sheridan Square
Her cell phone rings
Its, like, her stupid father
Be in the door by ten‚Äîagain
Pixeleen
Dream deep my three times perfect ultrateen
Pixeleen
Born in the bogs of Jersey
Trained how to love and spy hard
Dropped on the streets of Roppongi
Soaked through on the floor of a noodle shop
And when Abu rams the clip in the miniGlock
Up on the catwalk inside the warehouse
You whip a knife from the top of your gogo boot
Just a flash of spectacular thigh
Your pager starts to throb
Its your asif boyfriend Randall
Better keep it real‚Äîor whatever
Pixeleen
Rave on my sleek and soulful cyberqueen
Pixeleen
Penned by a hack in the Palisades
Backed by some guys from Columbia
Shot all in digital video
For a million and change
Flash back to cool summer nights
Freddy can we cut to the chase?
In a room above your garage
Everything about me is different
Symmetrical and clean
This is what I see
Just a girl in girlie trouble
Dancing in the video
With gun and tambourine
Pixeleen
Be good my three times perfect ultrateen
Pixeleen
Born on the floor of a noodle shop
Dropped in the bogs of Jersey
Shot by a guy from Columbia
Soaked through all in digital video
Girl with the sweet backstory
Pitched in a trailer in Burbank
Cast by a coolenough yes man
Screened at a festival in Utah
I would love to tour the Southland
In a travelling minstrel show
Yes, Id love to tour the Southland
In a traveling minstrel show
Yes, Im dying to be a star and make them laugh
Sound just like a record on the phonograph
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Hey, hey!
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time, yes I do
Cause he looks so fine upon that hill
They tell me he was lonely, hes lonely still
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
I stepped up on the platform
The man gave me the news
He said, You must be joking son
Where did you get those shoes?
Where did you get those shoes?
Well, Ive seen em on the TV, the movie show
They say the times are changing but I just dont know
These things are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Oh yeah, hey, hey!
I hear you are singing a song of the past
I see no tears
I know that you know it may be the last
For many years
Youd gamble or give anything
To be in with the better half
But how many friends must I have
To begin with to make you laugh
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?
You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel alright
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night
I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down you cant refuse
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?
I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down you cant refuse
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?
Your everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldnt even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I cant understand
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
You been tellin me youre a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time Ive known you
I still dont know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didnt turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I cant understand
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things weve done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I cant understand
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin in the years?
Stowin away the time?
Are you gatherin up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
We hear youre leaving, thats okay
I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart
Rikki, dont lose that number
You dont wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, dont lose that number
Its the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
I have a friend in town, hes heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I dont know
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki, dont lose that number
You dont wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, dont lose that number
Its the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
You tell yourself youre not my kind
But you dont even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki, dont lose that number
You dont wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, dont lose that number
Its the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
Rikki, dont lose that number
(Rikki, dont lose that number)
Rikki, dont lose that number
Quick, some redhots, cried the handsome fullback
Im so nervous at this lonely bivouac
All the men have long since gone to bed
Once again explaining why in Miss Cheever its always raining
And the roaring of the lamb
Brought my friends out in the rain
Now nobodys quite the same
No ones to blame
Theres a fight reported in the washdry
Smart Eugene refused to share his moonpie
What a shame they start them off so young
Whos to blame for this one
Wholl pay the prophet the day they miss one
And the roaring of the lamb
Then revealed its awesome powers
And the minutes turned to hours
No ones the same
Blandons baby broke for Eastern Parkway
Red Kimono torn and soaked in salt spray
Very chic, this wild thing on the run
Magnifique, beguiling Nell Gwines daughter
But no ones smiling
And the roaring of the lamb
Brought my friends out in the rain
Now nobodys quite the same
No ones to blame
Rose darling come to me
Snake Marys gone to bed
All our steaming sounds of love
Cannot disturb her in her night
Or raise her sleeping head
All I ask of you
Is make my wildest dreams come true
No one sees and no one knows
Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary dreams along
I would guess shes in Detroit
With lots of money in the bank
Although I could be wrong
You must know its right
The spore is on the wind tonight
You wont feel it till it grows
Rose darling (rose darling) my friend
With only you and what Ive found
Well wear the weary hours down
Rose darling come to me
The clock is close at hand
All my empty words of love
Can never screen the flash I feel
Or make you understand
Oh honey, cant you see
I know its real its got to be
Why not chase it where it goes
Rose darling (rose darling) my friend
With only you and what Ive found
Well wear the weary hours down
Rose darling (rose darling) my friend
With only you and what Ive found
Well wear the weary hours down
My old man
He been around the world
And he tells me everything
He told me how to tie a sailors knot
And made me how to swim
And though my man and I got it together
He still knows what to do
He say come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
You can tell me youre a man of means
And I wouldnt believe its true
Today I seen you selling door to door
And I know it makes you blue
Well youre bettin your dollar on the wind and rain
When you put your money down
I say come on and sail the waterway
And turn your head around
Come on and sail the waterway
And turn your head around
You know the tide is high
And the westward wind wont quit ya
And you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you
Well if youre tired of the race and the runners
And the things they make you do
I say come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
You know the tide is high
And the westward wind wont quit ya
Well you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you
Come on and sail the waterway with me
You go to Las Wages
Las Wages
You go to Las Wages
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
After closing time
At the Guernsey fair
I detect the El Supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs
Well Ive been around the world
And Ive been in the Washington zoo
And in all my travels
As the facts unravel
Ive found this to be true
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy
They got the shapely bodies
They got the Steely Dan Tshirt
And for the Coup de gr√¢ce
Theyre outrageous
Oh, honey let me tell you
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
Show biz kids making movies
Of themselves you know they
Dont give a fuck about anybody else
You know you gonna
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin
All the stars come out at night
Have you heard about the boom on Mizar 5?
People got to shout to stay alive
They dont even have policeman aone
Doesnt matter where you been or what youve done
Do you have a dark spot on your past
Leave it to my man hell fix it fast
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear
He will make your mug shots disappear
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Wont you sign in stranger
Do you like to take a yoyo for a ride
Zombie I can see youre qualified
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues
They will call you sir and shine your shoes
Or maybe you would like to see the show
Youll enjoy the cafe descargot
Folks are in a line around the block
Just to see her do the cancanjacques
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Wont you sign in stranger
Love or leave her, yellow fever
Sure, its all in the game
And who are you
Just another scurvy brother
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Wont you sign in stranger
Let me put it this way, doll
I know its getting late
I can tell from the planes of your face
That youre from out of state
But here in the Willows, now, heres the deal
Tomorrows for squares, and tonights for real
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how its done
Now, did you say you were from the Netherlands
Or was that nether world?
If you grew up in Amsterdam
Well, then Im the Duke of Earl
These tabs look iffy, but you say theyre good
Lets roll with the homeys and knock on wood
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
Show me where I turn
You are part of the dreaming
The end of my life so far
Or something halfway in between
You ought to know
Whered you go?
Whered you go?
Damn, she skipped dimensions
Was it something that I said?
Or something I was thinking
When she opened up my head?
Let me make it right, babe, never mind how
Theres a crazy little place I know called Be There Now
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how its done
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
This is where I turn
Thats right
Slang me
Jolly tricks
And politics
May pass you by
Soul ram
Little men
With stick pins
Leave you high and dry
Soul ram
Baby runs the show
Shes got a soul ram
Understand
Who could know
That shed be up on top
All night long
Never stop
Right or wrong?
Carousels
And wishing wells
Are fine for some
Soul ram
After dark
Tacoma Park
Can sure be fun
Soul ram
Baby oughta know
Shes got a soul ram
So well planned
I suppose
That she dont need her friends
Anymore
Just pretends
Knows the score
Baby let it grow
Shes got a soul ram
In her hand
Never knew
She dug the heavy stuff
Steely Dan
Play it rough
Backdoor man
Jelly roll
Cant save your soul
This mama can
Soul ram
Soul ram
Soul ram
Ten cent store is in my way
Just cant do what the captain say
Theres not enough night
And too much day
Aint got time to hear
That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
Wish I was a hired gun
Cruel shogun, a poor mans son
One day Id stop and click my heels
Turn around to see
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
The troubador is in disguise
Thats incurious, I used my eyes
My own two hands were on the keys
This is no mystery
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
When I lost my way home
I was helpless like a small child
No eyes of my own
That could take me through the nighttime
No moonlight to guide me
No shadow to hide me
Then in the dark I found Sun Mountain
I once had a friend
Tried to help me in a bad way
When I got to the end
Of a long and lonely highway
Strung out and downhearted
Right back where I started
There in the dark I found Sun Mountain
Here in my world I remember all the things I left behind
And if I need them they will be there, a part of my mind
Its only a house
And the rooftop is the blue sky
No windows or walls
And the days or years pass by
I slept throught the daylight
I woke up, it was midnight
There in the dark I found Sun Mountain
There in the dark I found Sun Mountain
Heavy hours are passing slowly
Dont believe that its unholy
Take a chance its what you want me for
Just once more
You know its not a sin
For you to lock me in
And throw away the key
Take it out on me
My complexion waxing whiter
Pull the wire a little tighter
Time goes quickly when youre occupied
Satisfied
Its wrong to scream and cry
When theres no need to buy
What you can get for free
Take it out on me
Now youre gonna see
What you are and what I am
Cigarettes and copper tubing
Touch a nerve no longer moving
I can make your demon disappear
Back in gear
And if you fall behind
Or when your state of mind
Is not what it should be
What you are and what I am
I was born and raised and lived and loved and died today
But when I saw the lights my word was hip hooray
It took me by surprise
It was right before my eyes
Talkin bout my home
The city in the sky
Talkin bout my home
The only home I ever known
Well youre halfway through the gate where you will live inside
Well I knew a dude who said it aint no trip he lied
Well I saw his face, oh God
When we crossed the promenade
Well now Ive got to catch that wonderful express
So Ill just say good evening to you all God bless
Just put me on that train
That great celestial plane
Any news was good news
And the feelin was bad at home
I was out of my mind and you were on the phone
Lonnie was the kingpin
Back in nineteen sixtyfive
I was singing this song when Lonnie came alive
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
You were Lady Bayside
There was nothing that I could do
So I pointed my car down seventh avenue
Lonnie swept the playroom
And he swallowed up all he found
It was fortyeight hours till Lonnie came around
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
(You gotta bring it on home)
Bring back the Boston rag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
(You gotta bring it on home)
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
(Bring it back, bring it back now)
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it aint no drag
(Been so long)
Bring back the Boston rag
I recall when I was small
How I spent my days alone
The busy world was not for me
So I went and found my own
I would climb the garden wall
With a candle in my hand
Id hide inside a hall of rock and sand
On the stone an ancient hand
In a faded yellowgreen
Made alive a worldly wonder
Often told but never seen
Now and ever bound to labor
On the sea and in the sky
Every man and beast appeared
A friend as real as I
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasnt even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood
Can it be this sad design
Could be the very same
A wooly man without a face
And a beast without a name
Nothin here but history
Can you see what has been done?
Memory rush over me
Now I step into the sun
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasnt even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasnt even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood
No Im never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
No Im never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Thats what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man
No Im never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Aint never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Thats what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man
No Im never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Dont make me do it without the fez on
Oh no
Thats what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man
Attention all shoppers
Its Cancellation Day
Yes the Big Adios
Is just a few hours away
Its last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
Youll need the tools for survival
And the medicine for the blues
The sweet treats and surprises
For the little buckaroos
Its last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
Weve got a sweetheart Sunset Special
And all of the standard stuff
Cause in the morning‚Äîthat gospel morning
Youll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough
Roll your cart back up the aisle
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye
Ride the ramp to the freeway
Beneath the blood orange sky
Its last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
And they wandered in from the city
Of St John without a dime
Wearing coats that shined both red and green
Colors from their sunny island
From their boats of iron they looked upon
The promised land where surely life was sweet
On the rising tide to New York City
Did they ride into the street
See the glory (see the glory of)
Of the royal scam
They are hounded down to the bottom
Of a bad town amid the ruins
Where they learn to fear an angry race
Of fallen kings, their dark companions
While the memory of their southern sky
Was clouded by the savage winter
Every patron saint hung on the wall
Shared the room with twenty sinners
See the glory (see the glory of)
Of the royal scam
By the blackened wall he does it all
He thinks hes died and gone to heaven
Now the tale is told by the old man
Back home he reads the letter
How they are paid in gold just to babble
In the back room all night and waste their time
And they wandered in from the city
Of St John without a dime
See the glory (see the glory of)
Of the royal scam
See the glory (see the glory of)
Of the royal scam
See the glory (see the glory of)
Of the royal scam
Pour out the wine, little girl
Ive got just two friends in this whole wide world
Heres to reckless lovers
We all need somebody
Stashed in the yellow Jag
Ive got my life and laundry in a Gladstone bag
You should know the program
Just one red rose and a tender goodbye
And I run to the second arrangement
Its only the natural thing
Who steps out with no regrets
A sparkling conscience
A new address
When I run to the second arrangement
The home of a mutual friend
Nows the time to redefine the first arrangement again
Its a sticky situation
A serious affair
I must explain it to you somehow
Right now Ill just move back one square
Here comes that noise again
Another scrambled message from my last best friend
Something I can dance to
A song with tears in it
Old friends abandon me
Its just the routine politics of jealousy
Someday well remember
That one red rose and one last goodbye
Then I run to the second arrangement
Its only the natural thing
Who steps out with no regrets
A sparkling conscience
A new address
When I run to the second arrangement
The home of a mutual friend
Nows the time to redefine the first arrangement again
Boys and Girls
They come from all around
From dear old Stockholm
To Copenhagen town
Forget their troubles
In tasty riddum n rime
So here you are
And now its party time
Wrap your mind
Around this sound
And let the goodness ripple down
Goodbye to Lonely Street
Youre in the Catbird Seat
At The Steely Dan Show
If you got backpacks
And pointy little shoes
Latemodel roadsters
Or just those walkin blues
A case of heartache
That youre too numb to fight
A secret sorrow
That keeps you up all night
Well dont you fret
Its not your fault
Just lay it all on Don and Walt
Just trip out on these hits
The groove that never quits
At The Steely Dan Show
So buy a program
And/or a hat
You dont pass up a deal like that
Its only promo stuff
But hey its good enough
At The Steely Dan Show
I dont mind the quiet
Or the lonely nights
I dont miss the funky attitudes
And I dont miss the fights
I lie on the couch til suppertime
And hunker down and read the Post
And thats when I remember the things I miss the most
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT
The house on the Vineyard
The house on the Gulf Coast
These are the things I miss the most
I kinda like frying up
My sad cuisine
Getting in bed and curling up with a girlie magazine
Sometimes in the corner of my eye
I see that adorable ghost
And then baboom I remember the things I miss the most
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The comfy Eames chair
The good copper pans
The 54 Strat
These are the things I miss the most
I had a little birdy friend
By morning she was gone
Birdie goodbye
Birdie bye bye
Im learning how to meditate
So far so good
Im building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood
The days really dont last forever
But its getting pretty damn close
And thats when I remember the things I miss the most
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT
The house on the Vineyard
The house on the Gulf Coast
These are the things I miss the most
Johnnys playroom
Is a bunker filled with sand
Hes become a third world man
Smoky Sunday
Hes been mobilized since dawn
Now hes crouching on the lawn
Hes a third world man
Soon youll throw down your disguise
Well see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy
I saw the fireworks
I believed that I was dreaming
Till the neighbors came out screaming
Hes a third world man
Soon youll throw down your disguise
Well see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy
When hes crying out
I just sing that Ghana Rondo
E lera del terzo mondo
Hes a third world man
Hes a third world man
Hes a third world man
This Seats Been Taken
What is the meaning of the morning rain
I got a feeling its no good
I waited for my baby, but she never made the train
Now Im hoping at the next stop she will be there
Shell catch my eye and satisfy my every care
(Chorus)
This seats been taken
Dont ask me where shes coming from
Youre quite mistaken
You know shes gonna be here
I know shes gonna come
She must have a reason I will understand
I know shell turn up by and by
Ill see her standing with a suitcase in her hand
And shell tell me how she couldnt find a pay phone
Shell start to cry, Ill realize Im not alone
(Chorus)
He takes all my money
You know Im through with Buzz
Yes Im through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh
Hes not very funny
You know Im through with Buzz
Yes Im through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh
I remember when he stole my girl
Drug her all around the world
You know Im cool, yes I feel alright
Except when Im in my room and its late at night
Maybe hes a fairy
You know Im through with Buzz
Yes Im through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh, all right
Lost in the barrio, I walk like an injun
So Carlo wont suspect
That somethings wrong here
I dance in place and paint my face
And act like I belong here
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them
Hot licks and rhetoric
Dont count much for nothing
Be glad if you can use what you borrow
So I pawn my crown for a ride uptown
And buy it back tomorrow
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them
Done like a matador, I pray for the weekend
And hope the little girls still throw roses
Else Ill change my bait and move upstate
Before the season closes
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them
Son you better be ready for love
On this glory day
This is your chance to believe
What Ive got to say
Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty
Dont the moon look pretty
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)
I am holding the mystical sphere
Its direct from Lhasa
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know
Children we have it right here
Its the light in my eyes
Its perfection and grace
Its the smile on my face
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)
Children we have it right here
Its the light in my eyes
Its perfection and grace
Its the smile on my face
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
Our town is just like any other
Good citizens at work and play
Normal folks doin business in the normal way
This morning was like any other
Mommies kissing daddies goodbye
Then the milkman screamed
And pointed up at the sky
Chorus
From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar
From Stargate and the Outer Worlds
Theyre speeding towards our sun
Theyre on a party run
Here come Tomorrows Girls
Tomorrows Girls
You see them on the grass at lunch hour
Soaking up the vertical rays
In their summer dresses
A little smile can really make your day
Their kisses feel like real kisses
And when they cry they cry real tears
But whats left in your arms
When the static clears
Chorus
Theyre landing on the Jersey beaches
Their engines make the white sand swirl
The heat is so intense
Earth men have no defense
Against Tomorrows Girls
In the cool of the evening
In the last light of the triple sun
I wait by the gotree
When the days busy work is done
Soon the warm night breezes
Start rolling in off the sea
Yes, at lantern time
Thats when you come to me
Come to me
Our home is just like any other
Were grillin burgers on the back lawn
Some time goes by
We fall asleep with the tv on
I dream about a laughing angel
Then the laugh becomes a furious whine
Look out fellas
Its shredding time
Chorus
Theyre mixing with the population
A virus wearing pumps and pearls
Lord help the lonely guys
Hooked by those hungry eyes
Here come Tomorrows Girls
Tomorrows Girls
Chorus
From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar
From Stargate and the Outer Worlds
Theyre speeding towards our sun
Theyre on a party run
Here come Tomorrows Girls
Tomorrows Girls
Crewmen of the true companion
I can see youre tired of action
In this everlasting twilight
Home is just a sad abstraction
Just beyond the troubled skyways
Young men dream of fire and star shine
Ive been dreaming of my own green world
Far across the reach of space time
With stocking face I bought a gun
The plan was set, the plan was done
Looked at my watch and started for the door
Now the food here aint so good no more
And they closed the package store
Love your mama, love your brother
Love em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know Im not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
Ill keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
My poisons named, you know my brand
So please make mine a double, Sam
Stir it up nice, Ill eat it right here
Yeah, this highway runs from Paraguay
And Ive just come all the way
Love your mama, love your brother
Love em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know Im not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
Ill keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
We warned the corpse of William Wright
Not to cuss and drink all night
Ticket in hand, we saw him laid to rest
Woah, but zombie see and zombie do
Hes here with me and you
Love your mama, love your brother
Love em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know Im not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
Ill keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
Turn that heartbeat over again
Bad news breaking in 18A
Missys kitty turn inside out she say
Spider queen demon and that whole crew
Across the lobby the wicker wing chair flew
All the nice people those goodly souls
Quaking in their respective hideyholes
Everyones wasted in this gruesome dream
Not a one of them left to hear you scream
Two against nature dont you know
Whos gonna grok the shape of things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Whos gonna break the shape of things unknown
Madame Erzulie she come last night
Bang you silly but leave a nasty bite
There on your nightstand much worse than that
Panatela and old black derby hat
Call your doctor  call your shrink
Western science she strictly rinkydink
They all masissi but we hang tough
Absotively gonna help you beat that stuff
Two against nature tan and lean
Puttin big heat on skanky things unseen
Two against nature slinging dread
These boys wanna bang the skulls of things undead
TBone Angie she champion liar
Sew the mouth shut with rusty chicken wire
Brother Lou Garue and the Jerry Garry
Sprinkling chicken water gonna hush all three
Beautiful housewife in deep distress
Specially you deserve our very best
Two against nature they got that stuff
Good things happening when you see about us
Two against nature love this gig
Pull up the weeds before theyre too damn big
Two against nature stand alone
Whos gonna chase the shape of things unknown
Two against nature dont you know
Whos gonna drop the boom on things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Gonna go bangzoom to the moon on things unknown
Scrape the wallboards the whole damn batch
Catch the maggoty eggs before they hatch
Pepper and ratbone make damn sure
Shake the rubbish out on the patio floor
Soak the timber with special spray
Nuke the itty bitty ones right where they lay
Whip the bastards while they still green
Take the firemop  sweep it kissing clean
Hey people
I cant seem to make up my mind ‚Äòcause Im undecided
Youre the reason why
My delay is just a way of telling you that I
I love you
Go away
I hate you
No please stay
I want you
Im so undecided
So divided inside of me
Hey baby
Suddenly I found that my whole world is turned upside down
And Im broken hearted I can testify
Who can free this part of me? Till then I know that I
I love you
Go away
I hate you
No please stay
I want you
Im so undecided
So divided inside of me
I love you
Go away
I hate you
No please stay
I want you
Im so undecided
So divided inside of me
I love you
Go away
I hate you
No please stay
I want you
Im so undecided
So divided inside of me
I love you
Go away
Brother in tears
Look at this chain of sorrows
Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone
I was Kid Clean
She was Anne de Si√®cle
Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow
It started out good
Then it got lots better
Makin up the rules as we went along
But with a business like this
Theres a gnarly downside
Im way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
Swingin so hard
We burned right through the summer
Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire
From the Rebus affair
To the streets of Culver City
Places and events slip below the horizon line
Now at this time
Into our pretty story
The truth compels us to bring a certain name
Meet if you will
Dr Warren Kruger
Im way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
She reached out for my hand
While I watched myself lurch across the room
And I almost got there
I almost got there
I almost got there
Almost got there
Look in my eyes
Dont you see the core is frozen?
You cant ask me to access the dreams I dont have now
Sadly for us
Our little talk is over
So together well endure the tyranny of the disallowed
Dont you love Port Blanc
When Hooterie is over?
When the girls get easy and the crowds are gone
A weekend of bliss
Then the rainy season
Im way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
Im way deep into nothing special
I was grinding through my day gig
Stackin cutouts at the Strand
When in walks Franny from NYU
We were quite an item back then
We talked about her films and shows and CDs
And I dont know what else
She said, yeah, Hollywoods been good to me
But tell me  how about yourself
Im still working on that novel
But Im just about to quit
Cause Im worrying about the future now
Or maybe this is it
Its not all that I thought it would be
What a shame about me
She said, talk to me, do you ever see
Anybody else from our old crew
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize
Now hes coming out with something new
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens
And Barry is the software king
And somebody told me in the early 80s
You were gonna be the Next Big Thing
Well now that was just a rumor
But I guess Im doin fine
Three weeks out of the rehab
Living one day at a time
Sneaking up on the new century
What a shame about me
What a shame about me
Im thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise
And the goddess on the fire escape was you
We both ran out of small talk
The connection seemed to go dead
I was about to say, hey, have a nice life
When she touched my hand and said
You know I just had this great idea
This could be very cool
Why dont we grab a cab to my hotel
And make believe were back at our old school
I said babe you look delicious
And youre standing very close
But like, this is Lower Broadway
And youre talking to a ghost
Take a good look its easy to see
What a shame about me
What a shame about me
Songwriters Donald Fagan and Walter Becker
I could be wrong but I have seen your face before
You were the man that I saw running from his door
You owed him money but you gave him something more
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
You were the founders of the clinic in the hill
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
When youre born to play the fool
And youve seen all the western movies
Woe to the one who does you wrong
Youll hide in the bushes
Murder the man
With Luger in hand
I understand that you will soon be leavin town
Dont try to call me when they finally run you down
Just give fair warning any time you come around
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
Hunting in the Sea of Japan
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him
So bold with his gun in his hand
Of his furs there was no need to remind him
Tripping over a Holy Man
Mind that here you dont choose your friends
Ambrose asked for a helping hand
He heaved his chest, and pointed West
To where the river runs
With Josie back home on his mind
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season
And Brosie was surely struck blind
By a sight that defies human reason
On an island of gleaming rock
Jutting up from the blue lagoon
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode
That made our hero swoon
A finer minor from China
The World when the traveler returned
As you know played out its bloody romances
But Ambrose he knew what hed learned
With his prize in hand he took his chances
Soon the sound that delights the ear
Blended in with the armies roar
When the warriors strained to hear
This new bebop, this shooting star
Their guns were bulletfull
A finer minor from China
A finer minor from China
A finer minor from China
Sir, I parked my juggernaut at your gate
Fifteenthousand miles and Im feeling great
Ive been on the run, but I done my time
You just cant stand still with a friend like mine
Theres a bear that walks like a man
Better shake him fast
Better hide yourself if you can
Cause he wants your ass
I believe youll do quite well
But only time will tell
If you got the bear or the bear got you
Drive the coach and six for the county line
Point me towards the tube and Ill be just fine
Mr Quick has flown from the cosmic zoo
Someone must be him and I just found you
Theres a bear that walks like a man
Better shake him fast
Better hide yourself if you can
Cause he wants your ass
I believe youll do quite well
But only time will tell
If you got the bear or the bear got you
Im about to cry and I dont know the reason
I can see the start of a difficult season
I cant let it get me down when everything is going wrong
Aint it good to know that I can be strong?
Darling as long as you go where I go
I cant complain about the pain and the heartache
The tears when your kisses disguise the lies
My eyes dont see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go?
Wake up in the morning where the bad news cant find me
Walking in the sunshine with you right behind me
This lazy living sure treats me right, but come tomorrow well be gone
And anywhere at all is where I belong
Darling as long as you go where I go
Im unaware of the cares and the sorrow
The hurt that your loving can hide from me
My eyes dont see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go?
Got a feeling Ive been here before
Watching as you cross the killing floor
You know youll have to pay it all
Youll pay today or pay tomorrow
You fasten up your beaded gown
Then you try to tie me down
Do you work it out in one by one
Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
I have seen your iron and your brass
Cant you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs, your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I dont need that kind of action
You dont have to dance for me
Ive seen your dance before
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the year of the locust youll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
Theres one roulade she cant sing
Dumb luck my friend
Wont suck me in this time
Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the year of the locust youll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
Theres one roulade she cant sing
Dumb luck my friend
Wont suck me in this time
Got a feeling Ive been here before
Wont you let me help you find the door
All you got to do is use
Your silver shoes, a gift for the runaround
Use your knack darlin
Take one step back darlin
There aint nothing in Chicago
For a monkey woman to do
Uhhuh
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
Who are these children
Who scheme and run wild?
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile?
What are the secrets
They trace in the sky?
And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by?
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door?
Who cover your action
And go you one more?
If youre feeling lucky
You best not refuse
Its your game the rules
Are your own win or lose
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
